a) Division of an integer by the integer value of 0
    1. No, although it outputs 0, it causes a run time error.
    2. "Received a value of 0
        10 / int_divisor has a value of 0"

b) Division of a double by the double value of 0.0
    1. Yes, it says that 10/0.0 is "inf"
    2. "Received a value of 0
        10.0 / double_divisor has a value of inf"

c) Square root of a negative number
    1. Yes, it says that the square root of -2 is nan.
    2. "Received a value of -2
        sqrt(sqrt_arg) has a value of nan"
